# ParallelProject
Given a set of N points in K-dimensional space. Each point X is marked as belonging to set A or B. 
Implement a Simplified Binary Classification algorithm to find a Linear Classifier. 
The result depends on the maximum iteration allowed and a value of the chosen parameter alpha. 
The purpose of the project is to define a minimal value of alpha that leads to the Classifier with acceptable 
value of Quality of Classifier.

I used 3 different tools to implement my solution: MPI, OpenMP and Cuda.
